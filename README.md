# Overview

As a software engineer, my goal is to continuously learn and improve my skills by exploring new technologies and working on diverse projects. This allows me to expand my knowledge and become more adaptable in different programming languages and work environments. By taking on challenging projects, I aim to broaden my expertise and stay up-to-date with the latest industry developments.

I wrote an application that allow users to connect to their Phantom wallet using the Solana library in TypeScipt. The Purpose of this project is to get familiar with creating projects on the Solana Blockchain. I want to have the option to become a Solana Developer in my portfolio.
